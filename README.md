# Forest Covertype Prediction

## Problem Discription:
In this project, you will use deep learning to predict forest cover type (the most common kind of tree cover) based only on \
cartographic variables. The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS)\
Region 2 Resource Information System data. The covertypes are the following:
- Spruce/Fir
- Lodgepole Pine
- Ponderosa Pine
- Cottonwood/Willow
- Aspen
- Douglas-fir
- Krummholz

## Project Objectives:
- Develop one or more classifiers for this multi-class classification problem.
- Use TensorFlow with Keras to build my classifier(s). 
- Use my knowledge of hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of my model(s).
- Test and analyse performance.
- Create clean and modular code.
